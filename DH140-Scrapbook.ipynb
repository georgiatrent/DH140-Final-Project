    "Response: This article took a bit of time to digest, for though I thought I knew the meaning of each new term he brought up, I needed to re-orient my brain to accept their many meanings and interpretations. As he points out, text can be defined many different ways, and it's possible for them to all be true and valid descriptions.  It's difficult at first to invite this uncertainty, and the possibility for every structure I rely on digitally to be redefined. Though I knew a lot of Humanities Computing dealt with text analysis, it was interesting to see that even 'text' as we know it can be interpreted as an abstract concept in this context, where in regular computing, it is a fact, a truth, that text is ... well, text. Depending on what you're doing, one thing is true. Text is a string, or text is an array of characters, etc. "

    "Donald Knuth is very well-known in computer science as the author of a set of books called \"The Art of Computer Programming,\" in which he covers many kinds of programming algorithms and their analysis.  It's also of interest to note that in the 1970's he got so frustrated with typesetting methods that he took time out to create TeX -- this became the foundation for LaTeX, the typesetting method that we can use in our Jupyter notebooks to render pretty equations with digital typesetting.\n",

    "What I have gathered about Knuth's claim - that computer programming is an art - is that each programmer must at a certain point discover what they like, what they find elegant about a program, and what they think makes a 'good' program. There is a similar refinement a painter might have in regarding paintings, i.e. knowing the techniques the other painter used, reflecting in choices the painter made (Is reality represented? Are mediums combined? Is there underpainting?), or deciding what paintings are 'tasteful'. I notice that my peers in computer science have differing 'styles' of programming. I also notice that my professors have different styles of teaching programming, which at times seems artful. Professor Eggert, for example, discusses history, relates topics to linguistics, and I think has included Knuth's book in his syllabus. He also often shares his opinions on certain syntaxes, or whether commented code is beneficial. I would consider him to be an artist. \n",
    "Relating to Python, each library you use has its own syntax and documentation. At times, they feel as though they have a certain personality - things like 'soup', or, in another example, the language OCaml (there are camel icons everywhere - a build system for OCaml is called 'dune'). This can even communicate a sense of how a library or language operates to the programmer that chooses to use it. \n",
    "I think also that Jupyter notebooks can help to illustrate the artistry of computer code, as they offer the medium of text to offer explanation or analysis. The author can also choose who is in the driver's seat: the code or the analysis. \n",
    "Sidenote: I like that he suggests that programming can be done 'pointlessly' or for fun, in the same way art can be. \n"

At first glance, almost all of the datasets I encounter I view with a bias that it is representative, that what it claims to represent is mostly true. But this blindness, supported by the common idea that data can be 'raw', can lead to errors in judgement like the example this chapter primarily discusses, the GDELT project. Even simply considering data to be 'cooked' rather than 'raw' helps to redirect this bias on first pass. \n",

    "For one, when I click on the links that are meant to display London's weather, the link doesn't work. It's broken, because the article relies on an outside source to display data. APIs can quickly become obsolete, or stop being supported, in a way that is completely unpredictable for the designer or programmer. Also, an API that used to be free can later require payment, or for a project to fulfil certain requirements. If the influx of data through an API is very important, is it the responsibility of the API developer to notify dependent projects of changes? This doesn't really make sense, but it does emphasize that APIs are different from languages as they can be updated without notice, and the programmer doesn't download a new 'version', so they aren't being notified of any changes that might break their program. \n"

    "The method that appeals to me the most is #1, Visualize single texts. I think I find it so appealing because it is a way to become spatially immersed in a 'text' in a way that reading doesn't, as to have the sensation of being immersed in reading one must forget that they are reading at all. In order to feel immersed in a visual representation is sometimes easier, especially if it's a representation of a text that has already been consumed. As the post reflects, these fictional networks can be very different from social networks, which is an intriguing thing to explore: if you can make a similar network using reality. Likely, it would be far more misleading, and particularly prone to bias, but if what you're creating is purely to represent one opinionated idea of reality, it could still have some merit. \n",

    "I often use Chat-GPT as a means of creating a sketch of an assignment or project, similar to how I might sribble on a page or canvas if the blankness is scaring me into not starting. I don't really trust it, though as my desperation in a subject rises, I might pray that it's right when I know that it probably won't be. I do think that it helps to provide an outline, a starting point, and can give suggestions, such as libraries to look into in Python. \n",

    "With that being said, I don't like that it's making my social media feeds confusing cesspools of generated content - I used to go on Instagram to see a few artists I enjoyed, and now I'm led into time-consuming scrolls, full of reels where a strange AI-generated video is captioned with a response about Russia's military history that often cuts off mid-sentence at the character limit. Though I know that new things are always scary before they become commonplace, I'm scared that the artists I used to look up to will struggle to promote their art, be stolen from by AI learning models, and will get fewer customers. The LLMs that use existing art to generate their photos will have less and less original art to base their probabilities. They might even start being trained on their own output, as it clouds up social media and even Stock photo sites. Walking around the city, I see posters for events that, on second glance, are clearly generated by AI. It's so creepy and soulless that I want to scream.\n",
    "I want to say that typing a prompt into an image generator or music generator or code generator does not make you a creative person. But I know that people said that about Photoshop, or probably oil paint when that first came out. Soon, a sort of skill in navigating AI will be respected and even useful. I just hate it. I can't like it. If I see one more old woman with 300+ wrinkles, seven fingers, holding 47 cats in the sky, I'm breaking my phone. "
