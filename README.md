# DH140-Final-Project
Final project repository for Digital Humanities 140. 


**Below are ideas for determining a final project topic**

**Data and Visualizations of interest**
1. [How AI-Human Collaborations in Art Deepen Audience Engagement](https://aibusiness.com/ml/how-ai-human-collaborations-in-art-deepen-audience-engagement)
2. [History of Philosophy - Summarized & Visualized](https://www.denizcemonduygu.com/philo/browse/)
This project is a digital humanities project and a data visualization, where an incomplete history of philosophy is represented in a web of supporting and contrasting notions.

**Ideas for data to investigate**
* Ancient Art History
  1. [Against Digital Art History](https://humanitiesfutures.org/papers/digital-art-history/)
  2. [3D model of babylon](https://www.kadingirra.com/)
* Privacy law
  1.[Cookie Consent Law in Spain](https://blog.didomi.io/all-you-need-to-know-about-cookie-consent-law-in-spain)
  2.[Deepfake Laws: Is AI outpacing legislation?](https://onfido.com/blog/deepfake-law/)
* Identity and belonging
  1. [Whales Tales, Dog Piles, and Beer Goggles: An Ethnographic Case Study of Fraternity Life](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3195675)
  2. [Nation Space, and Identity in the City: Marking Space and Making Place in Barcelona](https://www.jstor.org/stable/44013447)
  3. [When Anthropology is at Home](https://www.jstor.org/stable/223365)

**Ideas from curated datasets & project lists**

 Name | Description | Link
--- | --- | ---
Shapefile for 3-rd Republic France | Contains data depicting comprehensive geographic information of Third-Republic France. Coding may be useful in order to optimize visual representations of the data, as operations can become quite costly when representing so much data at once using graphics. You can also use other code to add texture to the geography, colors, or other information from other datasets (perhaps about demographics or production)  | [France](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/TRF-GIS)
Seeds | Measurements of the shape of wheat seeds. With code you could create a model for the ideal seed or the most highly recurring seed for selective plant breeding or monitoring changes that occur over time.  | [Seeds](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/236/seeds)
